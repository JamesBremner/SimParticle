The main goal is to have multiple types of particles on the screen at the same time.

If the left mouse button is down a particle is created at the cursor position.  Hold down the S key for stone, W key for Water and G for grain.

Sand grains will display yellow, water will be blue and stones will be black.

To demo how the different move algorithms are called dor each particle type: grains move down, water moves to the left and stones move to the right.
