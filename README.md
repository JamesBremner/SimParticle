The main goal is to have multiple types of particles on the screen at the same time.

Press the S key for stone, W key for Water and G for grain.

Particles are created at the mouse cursor position when the left mouse button is held down.  The particle type created is controlled by the last key pressed,: S, W, or G

Sand grains will display yellow, water will be blue and stones will be black.

To demo how the different move algorithms are called for each particle type: 
 - grains move down and pile up on the bottom with a slope of 45 degrees
